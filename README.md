example:

Every decision we make comes with a certain level of risk. It is important to understand what kind of statement you are
making when you make a decision. It is also important to distinguish between decisions that are permanent and those that
are not.

A statement is an official declaration that is made in an unambiguous way. Distinguishing refers to the ability to
differentiate one thing from another. Permanent decisions are ones that cannot be undone or changed. Risk is the chance
that an action might produce a negative result.

Statement：宣言；Distinguish：区分；Permanent：永久的；Risk：风险。
